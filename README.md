Online Food Order Simulation System 🍔🍕🥗
Project Overview

The Online Food Order Simulation System is a C program that allows users to order food from a menu and calculates the total bill based on the selected items and their quantities. It uses 1D arrays for menu prices, loops for bill calculation, and functions for order processing.

This project simulates a basic ordering system that helps users understand how real-life online food ordering apps work.

Why This Project Was Made

To understand ordering and billing logic in programming.

To practice using arrays and functions in C.

To learn how to take user input and process multiple items efficiently.

To develop a menu-driven interactive program for real-life applications.

Utility

Quickly calculate the total bill for multiple food items.

Helps beginners understand function-based programming.

Useful for learning how real-world ordering systems handle multiple orders.

Can be extended to add taxes, discounts, and special offers in the future.

Future Enhancement 🚀

Integrate GUI interface for better user interaction.

Add multiple user support and order history.

Include taxes, discounts, and delivery charges.

Add database support to save menu and order records.

Convert it into a full-fledged web-based ordering system.

What I Learned While Making This Project

How to use 1D arrays to store prices and quantities.

How to use loops to calculate totals dynamically.

How to write and call functions for modular programming.

How to handle user input validation.

How to simulate a real-life system using basic programming concepts.
